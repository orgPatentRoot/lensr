IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS DEPRECATED FOLLOWING MAJOR CHANGES TO THE LENS INTERFACE AND THE UPCOMING RELEASE OF THE LENS API. 

The Lens now includes a major Scholar component and is much more powerful. Please use [the main Lens interface](https://www.lens.org/) and I will aim to release a new rewritten version of the package when the dust settles on the changes and the API is available. Meanwhile thanks for the interest.
